## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I built this site using semantic HTML, making sure it is accessible to as many people as possible. The home page features useful information such as current statistics, installation instrucitons, and supported languages.

## Lessons Learned:

This project pushed me to be comfortable being uncomfortable with css. Playing with different properties taught me how versatile CSS is in getting an element to look exactly how I wanted it to look.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
